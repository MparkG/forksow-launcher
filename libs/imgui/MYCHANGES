Need a few changes to point at the correct headers.

imgui_draw.cc:

-#include "stb_rect_pack.h"
+#include "libs/stb/stb_rect_pack.h"

-#include "stb_truetype.h"
+#include "libs/stb/stb_truetype.h"


imgui_impl_glfw_gl3.cc:

-#include <imgui.h>
+#include "imgui.h"

-#include <GL/gl3w.h>    // This example is using gl3w to access OpenGL functions (because it is small). You may use glew/glad/glLoadGen/etc. whatever already works for you.
-#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
+#include "glad.h"
+#include "libs/glfw/include/GLFW/glfw3.h"

-#include <GLFW/glfw3native.h>
+#include "libs/glfw/include/GLFW/glfw3native.h"
